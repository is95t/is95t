### PhD Research

I am a PhD student in my second year at UCL, based in the Earth Science department. My research involves using machine learning to model thermodynamic properties of deep planetary melts â€“ that is using machine learning to find the equation of state. I mainly use gaussian process regression for this and have gained a solid appreciation for the mathematics behind these algorithms. Currently I am using Sci-Kit Learn and TensorFlow for this.

To obtain data for this work I run quantum mechanical simulations of the material to obtain the thermodynamic properties. This uses VASP code ran on ARCHER2 (UK national supercomputing facility) and returns data as a time series which needs to be averaged. For this, block averaging is used, and I have written my own program for doing this with VASP data (available at: https://github.com/is95t/VASP_block). 

Unfortunately, the code, data and model for this work has not been upload due to upcoming publications, however, can be made available on request. I am also happy to answer any questions or discuss it further so please get in contact. 

### Other Work

Other than my PhD research I also have completed projects using neural networks (e.g. MLP, CNN), SVMs and decisions trees. I also enjoy working with time series data (after dealing with this sort of data in my PhD research) and therefore have applied my interest in both time series and machine learning to stock market data. My projects outside my research can be found at: https://github.com/is95t/Projects.
